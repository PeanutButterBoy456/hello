/* Here is some interesting information:  The distillation process can take a relatively long time, especially when large amounts of water need to be boiled, cooled, and collected. In addition, this process requires fuel to heat the water and a sterile container to store it in. When distilled water is exposed to the air over time, it essentially becomes deionized water.
Deionization, on the other hand, can be performed relatively quickly â€“ especially if a mixed bed resin is used, so the water only needs to pass through one time. Many systems use two mixed bed cartridges or tanks, helping to ensure that all ions have been removed, but it's still a relatively fast process when compared to distillation. In addition, deionization is a chemical process, so energy is only typically needed to monitor the process and move the water through the system. If the DI resin is regenerated on site, this can add both time and expense to the process, however.
